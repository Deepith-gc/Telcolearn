## ✅ 1. Controller Logs

```
Default flow installed
High priority flow for h1
Medium priority flow for h2
Low priority flow for h3
```

**Meaning:**

* Ryu controller correctly installed the flow rules with priorities 300, 200, 100, 0.
* The switch is ready to match traffic based on these priorities.

---

## ✅ 2. Mininet Topology

```
h1-eth0:s1-eth1
h2-eth0:s1-eth2
h3-eth0:s1-eth3
```

**Meaning:**

* Single switch (s1) connected to three hosts (h1, h2, h3).
* Topology matches the lab plan.

---

## ✅ 3. Flow Table Verification

```
priority=300,ip,nw_src=10.0.0.1 actions=FLOOD
priority=200,ip,nw_src=10.0.0.2 actions=FLOOD
priority=100,ip,nw_src=10.0.0.3 actions=FLOOD
priority=0 actions=FLOOD
```

**Meaning:**

* Priority rules are installed correctly.
* Packets from h1 match highest priority first, then h2, then h3.
* FLOOD action sends packets to all ports; currently **no bandwidth control**.

---

## ✅ 4. Ping Test

```
h1 → h2: RTT ~0.158 ms
h2 → h3: RTT ~0.143 ms
h1 → h3: RTT ~0.173 ms
```

**Meaning:**

* Connectivity works perfectly.
* No packet loss, showing the network is functional.

---

## ✅ 5. Iperf Bandwidth Test

```
h1 → h2: 24 Gbits/sec
h3 → h2: 25.4 Gbits/sec
```

**Meaning:**

* Both flows get full bandwidth.
* **Priority rules only match traffic**, they do **not limit bandwidth yet**.

---

## ✅ 6. What Your Demo Proves

* Controller-driven flow installation ✅
* Priority-based flow matching ✅
* Network connectivity ✅

**Note:** To show **actual QoS**, you need OVS queues or meters.

---

## ✅ 7. Interview Tip

* **Safe explanation:**

> “We implemented priority-based flow handling using OpenFlow rules. The switch matches higher-priority rules first. Bandwidth guarantees would require queues or meters.”

---

If you want, the **next logical step** is a small upgrade to **actually control bandwidth per host** using OVS queues, which makes the QoS demo more realistic and impressive.

Do you want me to create that next?
